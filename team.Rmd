# Part 1
We will do some simple cleaning on the happy dataframe before we do an analysis.
1.
All missing values should be set to NA, including IAP, DK, and NA as a character type.
```{r}
happy <- readRDS("HAPPY.rds")
happy[happy=="IAP"]=NA
happy[happy=="DK"]=NA
happy[happy=="NA"]=NA
```

2.
Now, we'll set each factor to a data type rather than the default "factor", ensuring the elements of each column are a type we can work with.
```{r}
happy$age = as.numeric(happy$age)
happy$happy = as.character(happy$happy)
happy$marital = as.character(happy$marital)
happy$sex = as.character(happy$sex)
happy$finrela = as.character(happy$finrela)
happy$degree = as.character(happy$degree)
happy$health = as.character(happy$health)
happy$polviews = as.character(happy$polviews)
happy$partyid = as.character(happy$partyid)
```
